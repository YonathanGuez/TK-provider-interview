# It was an intresting technical Interview

## Introduction:

At the begining,the recruter send me a little message :

```
Hi Yoni,
To apply it starts here:
docker run -it traefik/jobs
```

I initially thought it was a joke, but it actually seems quite fun. After three days of not receiving any replies to my messages, which seemed serious, I decided to dedicate some time after work to play this game.

## Automation solution:

1. Open KillerCoda > playgrounds > k8s 1.32
2. copy solution.yaml and install.sh
3. add Permission

```
chmod 777 solution.yaml install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Development of the Resolution:

The image exists, and I can run the container. It gave me the message:
K8s, where are you? ü§î

What does that mean? What's inside the container that checks for a Kubernetes environment?
I first tried to inspect its contents using docker export COMMIT_ID > test.zip. I found nothing inside except for a start file.

I then tried running the start file directly in Linux, which displayed the same message. Attempting to look inside the file was difficult as it's a binary. Running strace ./start > execution.log 2>&1 suggested it was a Go language executable, which wasn't easily understandable.

After a little investigation, I decided to deploy it in my private Kubernetes environment. I had Kubernetes installed locally on a VM, but dealing with all the configurations to get it set up quickly was cumbersome, so I opted to use a free server from https://killercoda.com/.

I decided to create a Pod, and it returned a new message:
It seems I do need more permissions... May I be promoted cluster-admin? üôè
Hmmmm, it seems the Deployment has an issue üòí

So, I added some permissions and switched to a Deployment. This gave me another message:
Look at me by the 8888 ingress üö™

At this point, I realized I needed to build an Ingress. This involved installing an Ingress controller and then configuring my Ingress (which was truly a long process to find a good fit for a Private kubernetes !). Only to finally get:
Come on, you are applying to Traefik Labs! Get yourself a decent ingress üòè

As you can see, the frustration builds when you think you're done, but you're not at all. It seems we need to consult the company's official documentation for this challenge.

## For more information:

curl -v http://jobs.your.cluster.local:32742/

you will see the redirection:
http://jobs.your.cluster.local:32742/dashboard/

For see the all website dashboard it better to do that in the true server not in KillerCoda

this is what i found :

![Alt text](./img/Screenshot-dashboard.png)


last step and the last question gave by the website :
I have to tell you something...
Something that nobody should know.
However, everyone could see it.
It's not even hidden. Look at the docker image !
Come back when you know more.
But remember, it's a secret for traefik ü§´

so it thought to search with the name of the image but it was not usefull,
and i thought to check the composition of the image :

```cmd
docker inspect traefik/jobs
```

Result:
```
docker inspect traefik/jobs

That seem to be :

I tried if that hide something but i get the same answer everytime :
